//After the 2 initial 'put', C1's take should get seq_num=3, while C2's take should get seq_num=4
//Since C1's 'take' will arrive late to every server, C2's take will stay in the pending queue until 
//it finally executes.
//Expected: after approx. 5 sec, both clients succeed in taking the desired tuple; the final state 
//at all servers is empty (printed by C2)
