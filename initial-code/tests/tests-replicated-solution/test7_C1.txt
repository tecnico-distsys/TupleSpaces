//Both 'take's of C1 will not find any matching tuple when invoked, so they will be placed in a
//pending takes queue. Some seconds later, C2 puts the missing tuples (first <t1>, then <t2>), 
//which will unblock the pending takes of C1. 
//At the end of the run, C1 prints the state of every server, which should be empty.
